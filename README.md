# Hi, I'm Amin ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ’¼ Virtual Assistant â†’ Automation Enthusiast
I'm transitioning from VA work into automation and scripting. I work with:

- Google Apps Script (Sheets, Gmail, Drive)
- Python (Selenium, Pandas)
- SQL (basic queries and reporting)
- CRM platforms and campaign tracking tools (Instantly, Apollo)

## ðŸ”§ Projects
Here are a few projects I've built to save time and streamline tasks:

- `gmail-label-exporter`: Extract Gmail data to Sheets
- `daily-crm-report`: Daily campaign email counter
- `instantly-campaign-monitor`: Selenium bot to download and clean leads
